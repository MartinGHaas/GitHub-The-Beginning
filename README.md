# Hello everyone who is reading this!
This is my first repository to identify myself. Actually, it's a test to better understand github(at least the beginning). But, I don't want to let this be JUST A TEST, it has to have some content right?!

&#8226 I'm a young Brazilian looking to learn more about programming.<br>
&#8226 I used to play League of Legends, but idk, I think I've lost interest by playing it.<br>
&#8226 As a brazilian, I love playing and seeing soccer. Neymar is just the best player of the world :)
